What my (Stefan's) colleague wrote to make sure no split VPN is used on Mac:
* (network preferences, on the left hand side there is a list of networks, and a small "smiley" icon, click on this and select "set service order" (obviously)", drag the vpn on top (which is pretty hard to achieve but doable) probably it is enough to put it before wifi/cable network)
